      <h2>Why Blogify?</h2>
      <p>
        We understand that bloging can be difficult to get started with. Bloging
        should just be about bloging. No technicality. That is why we created
        Blogify. Blogify is a service designed to make bloging esier and more
        accessible. Why should you as a bloger worry about creating a website
        and get it up and running when we can help you with it. Blogify is
        designed to allow you to devote all your energy to your blogs, while we
        handle the rest.

        For as little as $12 a month you will be able to use our profesional
        tools, to create and design beautiful blogs with no coding experience.
        We will handle the rest such as making sure the blog is rendered
        properly, is up and running on a dedicated server and allow you to
        update your blogs in real time without having to worry about anything
        else.
